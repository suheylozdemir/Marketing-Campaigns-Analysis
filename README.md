Overview

This project evaluates the performance of three campaigns to identify the most profitable ones and make informed investment decisions. The performance of each campaign is assessed based on traffic, revenue, and profitability. The key findings are:

Aldebaran: The best performing campaign, showing consistent growth in traffic and revenue.
Bartledan: Although it attracts high traffic, the revenue does not cover the investment, leading to losses.
Cottington: Despite initial high revenue and gross profit, the increasing costs surpass the revenue, resulting in losses.
Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files and directories:

data/: Contains the data files.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebook files.
scripts/: Contains Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
README.md: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

Analysis Results and Recommendations

Key Findings
Aldebaran:
Performance: Best overall performance with consistent growth in traffic and revenue.
Investment: Weekly investment slightly decreasing, but revenue continues to increase steadily.
Recommendation: Continue investing, as it is the only campaign generating profit. Investigate weeks with drops in revenue per visitor.
Bartledan:
Performance: High traffic but insufficient revenue to cover investment, resulting in losses.
Recommendation: Stop investing due to unprofitability.
Cottington:
Performance: Initial high revenue and gross profit, but increasing costs exceed revenue, leading to losses.
Recommendation: Stop investing due to unprofitability.
Next Steps
Aldebaran:
Continue investing and investigate weeks with revenue drops to improve visitor engagement.
Consider making the website more attractive to convert traffic into engaged customers.
Bartledan and Cottington:
Stop investing due to poor performance and unprofitability.
Future Improvements

Deeper Analysis:
Conduct time series analysis to identify trends and seasonality.
Perform correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
Segment visitors based on demographics and behavior for targeted strategies.
Visualization Enhancements:
Create interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
Utilize various chart types for more effective data presentation.
Modeling and Forecasting:
Develop predictive models for traffic, revenue, and profit using machine learning techniques.
Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different campaign strategies.
Optimization:
Optimize budget allocation to maximize ROI using optimization techniques.
Identify and reduce unnecessary costs to improve profitability.
